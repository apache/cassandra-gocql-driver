// LZ4Compressor implements the gocql.Compressor interface and can be used to
// compress incoming and outgoing frames. According to the Cassandra docs the
// LZ4 protocol should be preferred over snappy. (For details refer to
// https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/operating/compression.html)
//
// Implementation note: Cassandra prefixes each compressed block with 4 bytes
// of the uncompressed block length, written in big endian order. But the LZ4
// compression library github.com/pierrec/lz4/v4 does not expect the length
// field, so it needs to be added to compressed blocks sent to Cassandra, and
// removed from ones received from Cassandra before decompression.
